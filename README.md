# Coursera-Version-Control-with-Git
This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Version control with git course by Atlassian and Coursera. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of importance of version controlling and particularly git. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
Give this repo a star, if you found it helpful.
